    Find connected components in a graph.

    For directed graphs, computes weakly connected components (ignoring edge direction).
    For undirected graphs, computes standard connected components.

    Args:
        graph: GraphFrame object containing the graph data
        method: Component type ('weak' for weakly connected, 'strong' for strongly connected)
        directed: Whether to treat graph as directed. If None, uses graph.is_directed
        backend: Backend selection ('auto', 'pandas', 'dask')
        max_iter: Maximum iterations for iterative algorithms (Dask label propagation)
