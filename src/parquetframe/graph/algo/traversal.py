    Perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal of a graph.

    BFS explores vertices in order of their distance from the source(s),
    visiting all vertices at distance k before any vertices at distance k+1.

    Args:
        graph: GraphFrame object containing the graph data
        sources: Starting vertex ID(s). If None, uses vertex 0 or first available vertex
        max_depth: Maximum depth to traverse. If None, explores entire reachable component
        directed: Whether to treat graph as directed. If None, uses graph.is_directed
        backend: Backend selection ('auto', 'pandas', 'dask')
        include_unreachable: Whether to include unreachable vertices with infinite distance

    Returns:

            - vertex (int64): Vertex ID

            - predecessor (int64): Previous vertex in BFS tree (nullable)

    Perform Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of a graph.

    DFS explores vertices by going as deep as possible along each branch
    before backtracking. Uses iterative implementation to avoid recursion limits.

        sources: Starting vertex ID(s). If None and forest=False, uses vertex 0
        max_depth: Maximum depth to traverse. If None, explores until leaf nodes

        backend: Backend selection ('auto', 'pandas', 'dask')
        forest: If True, performs DFS forest traversal over all components

    Returns:
