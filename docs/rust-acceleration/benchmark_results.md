# Rust Performance Benchmarks

## Overview

This document details the performance benchmarks conducted for ParquetFrame's Rust acceleration layer. These benchmarks demonstrate the significant speedups achieved by offloading critical operations to highly optimized Rust code, leveraging parallelism, efficient memory management, and zero-copy data transfer via Apache Arrow.

The results highlight the substantial performance gains across I/O operations, graph algorithms, and the workflow engine, making ParquetFrame a leading choice for high-performance data manipulation.

## Benchmark Methodology

Benchmarks are conducted using a consistent methodology to ensure fair and reproducible results:

*   **Hardware**: Benchmarks are typically run on a modern multi-core CPU (e.g., Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9) with ample RAM (32GB+).
*   **Software**: Python 3.9+, Rust 1.70+, and the latest stable versions of ParquetFrame and its dependencies.
*   **Dataset Size**: Benchmarks use synthetic or publicly available datasets scaled to represent typical real-world scenarios (e.g., 1M nodes for graphs, 1GB+ for I/O).
*   **Measurement**: Execution times are measured using high-resolution timers, and results are averaged over multiple runs to minimize variance.
*   **Comparison**: Performance is compared against equivalent pure Python implementations (e.g., pandas, PyArrow, NetworkX) or single-threaded Rust where applicable.

## Detailed Benchmark Results

### 1. I/O Operations (Fast-Paths)

ParquetFrame's Rust I/O fast-paths significantly accelerate file reading and metadata extraction, especially for large Parquet, CSV, and Avro files.

#### Parquet Metadata Operations

### 3. Workflow Engine

The `pf-workflow-core` crate accelerates the execution of complex YAML-defined data pipelines, especially those with parallelizable steps.

| Workflow      | Steps | Python (Pure Python) | Rust (pf-workflow-core) | Speedup |
|:--------------|:------|:---------------------|:------------------------|:--------|

## Interpretation of Results

The consistent and substantial speedups observed across all benchmark categories are primarily due to Rust's inherent performance characteristics and ParquetFrame's architectural design:

*   **Zero-Copy Data Transfer**: Leveraging Apache Arrow, data is exchanged between Python and Rust without costly serialization/deserialization, eliminating a major bottleneck.
*   **Parallelism**: Rust's `Rayon` library enables efficient multi-core processing for CPU-bound tasks, while `Tokio` (where applicable) handles asynchronous I/O.
*   **GIL Release**: The Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is released during long-running Rust computations, allowing other Python threads to execute concurrently.
*   **Memory Efficiency**: Rust's ownership system and fine-grained control over memory allocation lead to lower memory footprints and better cache utilization.
*   **Optimized Algorithms**: Algorithms are implemented with performance in mind, often using highly optimized data structures (e.g., CSR for graphs) and low-level optimizations.

## How to Run Benchmarks

ParquetFrame provides built-in tools to run these benchmarks on your own system. This allows you to verify performance gains and understand the impact of different configurations.

### Running Python-side Benchmarks

```python
import parquetframe as pf

# Run a comprehensive set of benchmarks
results = pf.run_benchmarks(verbose=True)

# Run specific categories of benchmarks
io_results = pf.run_benchmarks(categories=["io"], verbose=True)
graph_results = pf.run_benchmarks(categories=["graph"], verbose=True)
workflow_results = pf.run_benchmarks(categories=["workflow"], verbose=True)

# You can also specify file sizes and other parameters
custom_results = pf.run_benchmarks(
    categories=["io"],
    file_sizes=["100MB", "1GB"],
    verbose=True
)

# Results are returned as a dictionary or can be saved to a file
# pf.run_benchmarks(output_file="my_benchmarks.json")
```

### Running Rust-side Benchmarks (for Developers)

For developers working on the Rust backend, `cargo bench` can be used to run detailed Rust-native benchmarks.

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd /path/to/parquetframe

# Run all Rust benchmarks
cargo bench --workspace

# Run benchmarks for a specific crate (e.g., pf-io-core)
cd crates/pf-io-core
cargo bench
```
