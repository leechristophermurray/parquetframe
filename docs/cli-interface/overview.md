# CLI Guide

ParquetFrame includes a powerful command-line interface (`pframe`) that brings the full capabilities of the library to your terminal. Whether you need to quickly explore data, process files in batch mode, or work interactively with parquet files, the CLI has you covered.

## Quick Overview

The `pframe` CLI provides three main commands:

=== "Info"

    Get detailed information about parquet files without loading them into memory:

    ```bash
    pframe info data.parquet
    ```

=== "Run"

    Process parquet files with filtering, transformations, and output generation:

    ```bash
    pframe run data.parquet --query "age > 30" --output filtered.parquet
    ```

=== "Interactive"

    Start a full Python REPL with ParquetFrame integration:

    ```bash
    pframe interactive data.parquet
    ```
