//! Graph algorithms and data structures for ParquetFrame.
//!
//! This crate provides high-performance graph operations including:
//! - CSR/CSC adjacency structure building
//! - Graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)
//! - Advanced algorithms (PageRank, Dijkstra, Connected Components)
//!
//! Phase 0: Foundation - Placeholder implementation
//! Phase 1: Core graph algorithms will be implemented here

    /// Placeholder for graph functionality
    /// Will be implemented in Phase 1 (Graph Core)
    pub fn init() {
        // Phase 1 implementation: CSR/CSC builders, BFS, DFS
    }
}
