//! Workflow execution engine for ParquetFrame.
//!
//! This crate provides high-performance workflow orchestration including:
//! - DAG execution with topological ordering
//! - Concurrency management and resource scheduling
//! - Backpressure, retries, and timeouts
//!
//! Phase 0: Foundation - Placeholder implementation
//! Phase 5: Workflow executor will be implemented here

pub mod workflow {
    /// Placeholder for workflow functionality
    /// Will be implemented in Phase 5 (Workflow Executor)
    pub fn init() {
        // Phase 5 implementation: DAG executor, concurrency control
    }
}

        workflow::init();
